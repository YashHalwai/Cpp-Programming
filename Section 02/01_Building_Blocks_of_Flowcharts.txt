Flowchart In Programming

A flowchart is a diagrammatic representation of an algorithm. A flowchart can be helpful for both writing programs and explaining the program to others.

Flowchart is a graphical representation of an algorithm. Programmers often use it as a program-planning tool to solve a problem. It makes use of symbols which are connected among them to indicate the flow of information and processing. 
The process of drawing a flowchart for an algorithm is known as “flowcharting”.

Rules For Creating Flowchart :

A flowchart is a graphical representation of an algorithm.it should follow some rules while creating a flowchart
Rule 1: Flowchart opening statement must be ‘start’ keyword.
Rule 2:  Flowchart ending statement must be ‘end’ keyword.
Rule 3: All symbols in the flowchart must be connected with an arrow line.
Rule 4: The decision symbol in the flowchart cannot be associated with the arrow line.
 

Advantages of Flowchart:

Flowcharts are a better way of communicating the logic of the system.
Flowcharts act as a guide for blueprint during program designed.
Flowcharts help in debugging process.
With the help of flowcharts programs can be easily analyzed.
It provides better documentation.
Flowcharts serve as a good proper documentation.
Easy to trace errors in the software.
Easy to understand.
The flowchart can be reused for inconvenience in the future.
It helps to provide correct logic.
 
Disadvantages of Flowchart:

It is difficult to draw flowcharts for large and complex programs.
There is no standard to determine the amount of detail.
Difficult to reproduce the flowcharts.
It is very difficult to modify the Flowchart.
Making a flowchart is costly.
Some developer thinks that it is waste of time.
It makes software processes low.
If changes are done in software, then the flowchart must be redrawn
