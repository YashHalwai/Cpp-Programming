// Variables

/*

1) Variable Name : A label for a memory location.
2) Value : The something that would be stored in variable.
3) Storage : A placed where data can be stored.
4) Declaration: Announcing a variable (usually) at the beginning of a program.
5) Naming Convention : A set of rules about the names of variables.

/*

Naming Variables:

1) For variable name we can use uppercase and lowercase letters, digits from 1 to 9 and underscore(_).

2) First character must be underscore(_) or letter. 

3) C++ is strongly typed language. So every variables need to be declared before using it.

// Valid Names

double simple_interest;

int student_age;
float student_percentile;
int yash123;

// Invalid Names

int 123_age;

*/

/*

// Initialisation 

1) Variables when just declared have garbage value until they are assigned a value for the first time.

2) We can assign a specific value from the moment variable is declared, called as initialisation of variable.

// Initialisation of Variable

float a = 10;

// Declaration

int b;

// Assignment

b = 20;
