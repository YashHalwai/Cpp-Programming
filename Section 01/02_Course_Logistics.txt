Is C++ hard to learn?

Yes, C++ is hard to learn both for people who're completely new to programming and to others who've programmed before but never specifically done low-level programming before (like C or Assembly).

But there's hope.

I'll breakdown a few areas you'll need in order to master C++ fast but let's talk timeline first.

If you're completely new to programming, it'll take at least 3 months to learn C++. That's working at least 2 to 3 hours each day. However, if you've programmed before, working at least an hour a day, it'll take 1 to 3 months to grasp the basics.

And if you want to build mastery in C++, it'll take at least 2 years.


C++ for beginners and how to approach it

Are you an absolute beginner programmer?

If yes, it's a bad idea if you're completely new to programming and you turn to C++ as your first language.

Particularly if you're a self-taught programmer.

Why?

Because there are better entry-point languages. As an absolute beginner you're better off starting with something like Python or JavaScript.

If you're in school and you have no choice – many schools still start students off with C++ as their first language, which drives students away – just learn as much of C++ as you can.

But don't give up if you end up not liking it.

There are many other programming languages that can keep you excited about programming in general.

If C++ doesn't do it for you, try others.

What you'll need to learn the basics of C++

Like any programming language, you need to know how to:

declare variables
collect user input
store information
repeat an action through loops
write functions to repeat blocks of code
These are standard.

And if you already know how to code, it won't be a big deal.

Maybe a little annoyance here and there, especially arguments among C++ fans about using ; or whether it should be completely dropped.

It's a fun debate to have. But don't get too hung up on it.

Current programmers looking to learn C++

If you're a C programmer, you'll end up loving C++.

But if you're not, C++ will likely still be a hassle. Even if you already know how to code, C++ is a beast to handle especially if you've never coded in a low level language like C or assembly.

For instance, most people who code in Python, Laravel, JavaScript don't ever have to think of memory management.

So C++ can come off as a shock because of all the pointers and constant memory management learnings. They may seem unnecessary but you absolutely need to master them.

Happy Coding :)
